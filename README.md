###  [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.05901.pdf) | [Video](https://www.youtube.com) | [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1sE0VmWCuL6HUad3yXHEZoCvJKzAvINpz?authuser=1#scrollTo=_p7km19VLzx3)

We introduce an innovative approach for estimating camera trajectories and 3D scene structures from multiview image keypoints by utilizing a pretrained depth prediction network that efficiently separates camera pose estimation and depth fine-tuning and a SIM-Sync solver to optimally solve the structured problem of camera trajectory estimation. The approach is validated through experiments on the TUM dataset.
